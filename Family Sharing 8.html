<td><font style="font-family:Lucida Grande"><font size="6"><b>8.</b><br></font><font size="2">On the above screen, you can choose "Add Family Member" to send a request to someone in your contacts list, or by email address. They will receive a notification on their devices asking for confirmation. You will get a notification when they accept, and they will show up in the above menu. Alternatively, if you want to add a child to your family who doesn't yet have their own Apple ID, tap "Create an Apple ID for a child" at the very bottom. You must be 13 years or older to have an Apple ID, but for younger children, you can tap that menu to create an Apple ID dedicated for Family Sharing. You must have a credit card on file (not debit card, gift card, or anything else) to share purchases in this case.</font></font></td>
