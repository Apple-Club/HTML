<p style="margin:0px"><font face="arial, sans-serif">This "Mixed Content Blocking" feature first introduced in Firefox 23 is a real pain for website owners. We understand that the goal here is to prevent eavesdropping by blocking HTTP content on HTTPS pages. However, as a result, visitors cannot see certain interfaces on our site, and in some cases, this means that they cannot access the help or information they sought out. At the least, Mixed Content Blocking should not apply to HTTP content that does not ask the user to fill out any information, as such content is harmless. At best, you could find an alternative way to make users safe on the web that is also more website developer friendly.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0px;min-height:14px"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin:0px"><font face="arial, sans-serif">In summary, Mixed Content Blocking does the user no service if there is no information being requested for eavesdroppers to see, and can in fact, harm their experience if useful information or content is being blocked.</font></p>
<p style="margin:0px;min-height:14px"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br>
</font></p>
<p style="margin:0px"><font face="arial, sans-serif">We look forward to a resolution to this. In the meantime, we have had to post a notice to our visitors recommending using an outdated version of Firefox (22 or less), or using a different browser. We also explain how Mixed Content Blocking can be disabled, but for the real layman user this may not be something they are willing to do.</font></p>
